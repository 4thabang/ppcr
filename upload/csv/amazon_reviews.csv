"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2021",Amazon Customer,yes,yes,SUCKS,"So I bought this cream after searching several numbing creams and came across this one and read reviews of how people have used this specific one for tattoos , piercings, etc. I purchased it, in hopes of using it to numb me so I can get nipple piercings. I tried it a day before just to test it out. I applied a generous amount two times within 1 hour and never was numbed.The following day ( day i was ready to get pierced) i tried the product again just to be sure if it worked or not, it still did not work to numb. My friend also tried it on herself and it did not work for her either. So im not sure why it worked for others and we did not get that same experience, but this was a waste of purchase, and time. #VeryUnhappy. #NotSatisfied #SomeoneLied.",1,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGHRNDAY2CX4M/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082WYC6JP,B082WYC6JP,Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)
"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2021",RJ,yes,yes,False advertisement. Scam. I highly don't recommend. Read full comment,"This doesnt work very well at all. Followed the directions but no numbing. Not until you actually tattoo and then apply to the area, does it do any numbing. Was definitely let down by this because its not worth the price. I do NOT recommend. Also the directions they explain on here isn't the same as on the tube. Does NOT numb the area prior to doing a tattoo. Im just thankful i took precautions and tried it on myself before anyone else. I would have had some not too pleased customer just as im not too pleased.Update: They continued to email me asking me to take down my review and credit me half of what I paid... Said if I gave a 5 star and good review, they'd then credit me for the full price. ~BEWARE OF THIS SCAM~ Im not changing my review. This went back and forth a while. So i said I didnt want the money back and that this review will stay. Asked me to lie to get my money back... Thats bad business.

This Base Labs supposed 5% lidocaine cream is the first one I have ever used that does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I was really quite surprised at how completely ineffective it is.
